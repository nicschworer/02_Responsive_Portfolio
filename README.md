# 02_Responsive_Website

This is the second formal homework assignment in the Columbia Engineering Coding Bootcamp. The assignment is to create a responsive portfolio website. I have a feeling we will iterate on this a lot this course. 

To develop this, I used HTML, CSS. I didn't write any JavaScript, but rather used the Bootstrap JS for the Bootstrap elements I used. 
Building the actual website wasn't too challenging, it was making it responsive and adaptable to mobile that was tricky. I used media queries to alter the page renderings depending on how the size of the screen. Surprised at how few pixels there are in the width of an iPhone X. 

The last thing I did was HTML validator which was a great exercise. There were about 4 mistakes on my contact page and 2 on my portfolio page (mixed up ID names and open divs). Not sure if that's good, but I feel pretty good about it. I was also able to easily identify and fix the issues.
